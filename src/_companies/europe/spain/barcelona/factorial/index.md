**Factorial is not looking for a long list of skills and technologies.** The stack is Ruby on Rails for the backend and React/React-native for the clients, but it’s not mandatory to be proficient in those (most of the team came with other areas of expertise which is very enriching, Factorial will help you catch up with the Factorial: University 🎓 fast). Factorials believes that someone who has good aptitudes and is hungry for learning is what works best.
