Founded in 2009, Go Free Range is a worker co-operative with some of the most experienced application developers in the UK. Although using Ruby and Rails is what brought them together, their many years of experience mean that they’re comfortable turning their hand to most languages. Collectively they have experience of Java, Python, Rust, JavaScript and more. They’ve worked on substantial projects for the likes of O2, the Government Digital Service, FutureLearn, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
