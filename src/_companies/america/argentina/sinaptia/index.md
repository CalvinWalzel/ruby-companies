SINAPTIA started as a company who wanted to do things differently, not only focusing on delivering quality code but building a team of people who were happy at work. With that goal in mind, we started operating in 2013.

Since then, it has been trusted by several small clients that needed their product to grow, and is still working with most of them.

Over the course of the years SINAPTIA had the chance to work with entrepreneurs, startups and even enterprise level companies. In industries such as ecommerce, retail, digital signage, ciber security and hospitality. From business ideas that became a product, to working with big enterprises, SINAPTIA took every challenge with the same responsibility. That was what permitted it to grow, and have a team that's motivated and happy to be here.
